### Mathematical Models and Risk Metrics

**Volatility Ventures 3.0** employs advanced mathematical models to simulate realistic trading scenarios and assess portfolio performance.

#### Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM)

- **Purpose**: Models the stochastic behavior of asset prices.
- **Formula**:
  
  \[
  S_t = S_0 \times e^{(\mu - \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2) \Delta t + \sigma \sqrt{\Delta t} \times Z}
  \]
  
  - \( S_t \): Asset price at time \( t \)
  - \( S_0 \): Initial asset price
  - \( \mu \): Drift coefficient (expected return)
  - \( \sigma \): Volatility coefficient
  - \( \Delta t \): Time increment
  - \( Z \): Standard normal random variable

#### Risk Metrics

1. **Sharpe Ratio**:
   - **Formula**: \( \text{Sharpe Ratio} = \frac{R_p - R_f}{\sigma_p} \)
   - **Where**:
     - \( R_p \): Portfolio return
     - \( R_f \): Risk-free rate
     - \( \sigma_p \): Portfolio standard deviation
   - **Interpretation**: Measures risk-adjusted return. Higher values indicate better performance.

2. **Value at Risk (VaR)**:
   - **Parametric Approach**:
     - **Formula**: \( \text{VaR}_{\alpha} = \mu_p + \sigma_p \cdot z_{\alpha} \)
     - **Where**:
       - \( \mu_p \): Portfolio mean return
       - \( \sigma_p \): Portfolio standard deviation
       - \( z_{\alpha} \): Z-score for confidence level \( \alpha \) (e.g., 1.645 for 95%)
   - **Interpretation**: Estimates the maximum expected loss over a specified period at a given confidence level.

3. **Maximum Drawdown**:
   - **Formula**: \( \text{Max Drawdown} = \frac{\text{Peak Value} - \text{Trough Value}}{\text{Peak Value}} \)
   - **Interpretation**: Represents the largest drop from a peak to a trough in portfolio value. Lower values indicate better risk management.

### Visualizations

**Volatility Ventures 3.0** incorporates interactive Plotly visualizations to provide real-time insights into your portfolio and risk metrics.

1. **Asset Price History**:
   - **Description**: Interactive line charts showing the price evolution of each asset across all rounds.
   - **Features**: Hover tooltips, legend toggling, zooming, and panning for detailed analysis.

2. **Risk Metrics Over Time**:
   - **Description**: Combined plots for Sharpe Ratio, VaR, and Maximum Drawdown across rounds.
   - **Features**: Dual y-axes for different metrics, interactive legends, and real-time updates.

### Save & Load Functionality

Maintain your game progress with robust save and load features.

- **Save Game**:
  - **Function**: Click "Save Game" to store your current game state.
  - **Details**: The game state is saved as a JSON file with a timestamp for easy identification.

### Mathematical Models and Risk Metrics

**‚öñÔ∏è Leverage Labyrinth üåÄ** employs advanced mathematical models to simulate realistic trading scenarios and assess portfolio performance under leverage.

#### Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM)

- **Purpose**: Models the stochastic behavior of asset prices, incorporating drift and volatility.
- **Formula**:
  
  \[
  S_t = S_0 \times e^{(\mu - \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2) \Delta t + \sigma \sqrt{\Delta t} \times Z}
  \]

   - **Formula**: \( \text{Sharpe Ratio} = \frac{R_p - R_f}{\sigma_p} \)
   - **Where**:
     - \( R_p \): Portfolio return (leveraged)
     - \( R_f \): Risk-free rate
     - \( \sigma_p \): Portfolio standard deviation (leveraged)
   - **Interpretation**: Measures risk-adjusted return. Higher values indicate better performance.

2. **Value at Risk (VaR)**:
